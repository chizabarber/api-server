                To get something out of the way, yes — I am aware that between <a href="https://www.chizabarber.com">ChizaBarber.com</a> and <a href="https://www.chizabarber.dev">ChizaBarber.dev</a>, visitors to my site(s) may be confused about what it is that I actually <em>do</em>, and what kind of position I'm trying to get into. 
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <p><i>&quot;Is she a developer or an administrator or what?&quot;</i></p>
            </blockquote>
            <p>
                Point taken. For the sake of quick employment, it would probably be in my best interest to buckle down on one or the other. There aren't (m)any developer jobs on the market needing people with admin experience, or vice versa.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it feels disingenuous to leave out aspects of my skillset simply to send a more targeted message. As my sites evolve, it's my hope that I'll find my target audience in those employers who are not confused by, or dismissive of, my mishmash of skills. Ideally because my mishmash is exactly what they need.
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-subtitle center-align">
                All The Hats
            </h5>
            <p>
                I've only ever worked for smaller companies. These include family-owned businesses, startups, and even a small game developer. What I liked best about these jobs was that, <em>because</em> the companies were small, I had the opportunity to wear multiple hats and take initiative on projects not specific to my job title.
            </p>
            <p>
                While an employer may be thrilled to have a team member who goes above and beyond their official responsibilities, I'll admit my intentions were not altogether altruistic. See, I only took on side projects that I <em>wanted</em> to, because they were in line with my passion for digital communication.
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-subtitle center-align">
                The Digital Space
            </h5>
            <p>
                Ever since my love affair with the internet began in the early 90's, I have been collecting skills relevant to the digital space. These include copy writing, graphic design, blogging and webmastering, social media and email marketing / management, and most recently, full-stack web development.
            </p>
            <p>
                I've worked in customer support and office administration roles for more than a decade. The skills I listed above might seem irrelevant to those roles, but they stood me in good stead as my employers moved to more tech-based solutions for their teams and customers, and as I moved into more tech-related industries. Being the quickest team member to learn new tools and systems, I've often been tasked with teaching others and implementing new tools to streamline our processes.
            </p>
            <p>
                Invariably I would run into a problem so specific to my team's needs that no solution for it existed on the market yet — or if it did, it was too expensive or one-size-fits-all to be helpful. This is what inspired me to stop puttering around with free coding courses online and finally enroll in a <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com/">coding bootcamp</a>. If I wanted custom solutions, why not make them myself?
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-subtitle center-align">
                A Custom Solution
            </h5>
            <p>
                In the end, that's what I love to do. Most problems can be solved by imparting clarity to an issue; the challenge, I believe, is in communicating effectively enough so that clarity actually emerges from the chaos. While nothing can replace personal communication with clients and customers or between team members, there is something equally irreplaceable about communication via the digital medium.
            </p>
            <p>
                Everything from Trello scrum boards, to data-vis dashboards, to LinkedIn infographics, to Facebook ad campaigns are essentially doing the same thing. It's a message that <em>stays</em>. It's information that can be acted upon.
            </p>
            <p>
                I realize that most companies employ teams to handle the various aspects of digital communication — both internally and externally. Time is of the essence, after all. But my experience has taught me that every company's needs are different. Your company might be in need of someone to fill a hybrid role. Or maybe you need an admin who can competently speak to teams of disparate disciplines.

            snippet: 'I\'m past due to re-enter the workforce. As much as I\'ve enjoyed this...',
            text: `<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/chizabarber/ssr-server/master/src/images/Icon2.png" alt="img" class="blog-image">
            <p>
                I'm past due to re-enter the workforce. As much as I've enjoyed this sabbatical, I'm on the hunt for a new position that puts my new skills to good use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The actual job search and application process only takes up so much of my time. I'm left to fill the rest of it with projects of my choosing, and it occurs to me that the best projects to choose right now are those that facilitate my search while allowing me to keep my skills up to date.
            </p>
            <p>
                More than just a portfolio site, more than an online parking spot for my resumé, ChizaBarber.com is one such project.
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-subtitle center-align">
                Why #1: Because resumés are limited.
            </h5>
            <p>
                A record of past jobs plus an inventory of skills picked up along the way. This information is necessary for sure, but it does little to communicate an individual's level of mastery to a potential employer.
            </p>
            <p>
                Skills have to be demonstrated. Pre-interview tests are one way to demonstrate ability, but a lot of time might be saved for both job-seeker and employer if the initial impression relied on more than just the seeker's resumé.
            </p>
            <p>
                My eventual goal with <a href="https://www.chizabarber.com">ChizaBarber.com</a> (along with its sister site <a href="https://www.chizabarber.dev">ChizaBarber.dev</a>) is to demonstrate the following to potential employers:
            </p>
            <blockquote><i>My ability to organize information and present it in an easily understood way</i></blockquote>
            <blockquote><i>My ability to solve problems and address challenges with programming</i></blockquote>
            <blockquote><i>My pride for being a self-starter who consistently goes above and beyond expectations</i></blockquote>
            <p>
                As of writing this blog post, my sites are not quite there yet, but they'll get there! Stay tuned. :)
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-subtitle center-align">
                Why #2: Because coding bootcamp is over.
            </h5>
            <p>
                My time in the <a href="https://www.digitalcrafts.com/full-stack-flex.html">DigitalCrafts Full-Stack Flex Program</a> was a turning point in my life, and in an odd way I wish I never had to leave it. But, graduation has come and gone. Here on out, it's on me to keep this new skillset polished.
            </p>
            <p>
                To that end, Udemy has been my resource of preference. A particular shout-out to Stephen Grider's courses for helping me wrap my brain around the React &amp; Redux ecosystem.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently the <code>/code</code> route of ChizaBarber.dev leads to my professional GitHub profile. In the future, I intend to use the route for my coding journal. There I'll post my code snippets, questions, articles, and basically create my own personal Stack Overflow.
            </p>
            <p>
                (As an added bonus, visitors to my site will see that I haven't sat around getting rusty after bootcamp. Yay productivity!)
            </p>
            <h5 class="blog-subtitle center-align">
                Why #3: Because you don't know who I am.
            </h5>
            <p>
                I first encountered the concept of culture fit when I worked in staffing &amp; recruiting. It was a bit of an eye-opener for me that our clients may pass over a technically perfect candidate because they were a poor culture fit.
            </p>
            <p>
                The disappointment of such a mismatch is often compounded by the fact that it tends to happen late in the interview process. I figure if I let a bit of my personality leak out in these blog posts, it will mitigate the risk of wasted time and resources on both sides.
            </p>

                If you are reading this, whether you decide to <a href="mailto:admin@chizabarber.com">reach out</a> to me or not, I appreciate you spending your valuable time on getting to know me!
